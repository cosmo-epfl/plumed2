Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
