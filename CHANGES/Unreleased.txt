@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.3

Changes from version 2.2 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - \ref COMMITTOR can now be used to define multiple basins, but the syntax has been changed
  - Syntax for \ref SPRINT, \ref DFSCLUSTERING, \ref DFSCLUSTERDIAMETER, \ref DFSMAXCLUSTER \ref DFSNUMEROFCLUSTERS has changed.
    We have separated the Actions that calculate the contact matrix from these actions.  These actions thus now take a contact
    matrix as input.  This means that we these actions can be used with contact matrices that measures whether or not a pair of atoms
    are hydrogen bonded.  For more details on this see \ref contactmatrix 
- In \ref driver masses and charges are set by default to NaN.
  This makes it less likely to do mistakes trying to compute centers of mass or electrostatic-dependent variables
  when masses or charges were not set. To compute these variables from the driver you are now forced to use
  `--pdb` or `--mc`.
- New actions:
  - \ref FIXEDATOM
  - \ref HBOND_MATRIX
  - \ref DFSOUTPUT
  - \ref ROWSUMS
  - \ref COLUMNSUMS
- New features for existing actions:
  - The SPECIES and SPECIESA keyword in MultiColvars can now take a multicolvar as input.  This allows one
    to calculate quantities such as the Q4 parameters for those atoms that have a coordination number greater
    than x.
  - In rational switching functions, by default MM is twice NN. This is valid both in \ref switchingfunction with expanded
    syntax and when specifying MM on e.g. \ref COORDINATION
  - Added MATHEVAL type in \ref switchingfunction
